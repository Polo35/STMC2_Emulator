Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to write an emulator for the ST Micro Connect 2.

The ST Micro Connect 2 aka STMC2 box is used to connect boards based on ST Microelectronic socs over a JTAG interface.


The STMC2 box is linux based and is wrote in python.
So for convenience, the emulator will have to run on a linux platform, and will be written in python.

ST Linux (http://www.stlinux.com) provide tools to handle the STMC2 box and is well documented.
There is also some utilities for configuration and debugging.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STMC2 Knowledge
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is 3 distinct parts in the STMC2 box.

- The Hardware check part.
	A simple socket server started on port 9735, which return 'STMC2' when requested.

- The System Manager part.
	A XML RPC Server used to configure the STMC2 box.
	It return informations on STMC2 states, firmware version, ...
	It also manage the target manager.

- The Target Manager part.
	A XML RPC Server used to communicate with the soc.
	It manage targetpacks used to describe a target system.
	This is the big part, but we are lucky because a complet target manager is available in ST Linux.
	Basicaly, it is charged of peek/poke, and Jtag lines handling.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TargetPacks Knowledge
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Targetpacks are used to describe and operate on a specific board.

There is 2 distinct parts in a targetpack.

- The static part.
	A set of xml files used to describe a specific board based on a specific soc.

- The dynamic part.
	A set of python files used to operate with a specific board based on a specific soc.

ST Linux provide targetpacks for all ST socs, and good documentations describing them.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current project state
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The Hardware check part.
	Fully functional.

- System manager part.
	Largely acky, but work pretty well.

- Target manager part.
	Under test.
	After analyzing the targetmanager provided by ST Linux, it appear that some driver need to be rewritten to handle peek/poke and Jtag lines.
	But the biggest part wrote in python is available.

How to test STMC2_Emulator.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you need to install ST-Linux 2.3 on a linux platform.

Open a terminal and go to '/opt/STM/STLinux-2.3/host/stmc/bin'


To launch stmcconfig with STMC2 Emulator on 192.168.0.10:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/STM/STLinux-2.3/host/stmc/lib STMC_DEBUG=1 STTP_DEBUG=1 STMC_RPC_DEBUG=1 ./stmcconfig.real --ip 192.168.1.20 --status


To launch sttpdebug for mb442 board with STMC2 Emulator on 192.168.0.10 type:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/STM/STLinux-2.3/host/stmc/lib STMC_DEBUG=1 STMC_RPC_DEBUG=1 STPY_DEBUG=1 ./sttpdebug.real 192.168.1.20:mb442:st40
